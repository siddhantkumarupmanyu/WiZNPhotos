I know this is not the best structure not the cleanest code. I want to improve it so much
But it's time.
The most compelling this I want ot do is to implement viewpager with pagination. But it will take time
and that I do not have right now. Maybe I will revisit this app
That pagination with viewPager will actually bring me back. I am sure. And make me implement it
with a custom indicator.

I actually want to implement pagination in ListFragment too.
I didn't cause the assignment didn't said anything about it either.
Also, I wasted so much time trying to make viewpager2 work with pagination, and in the end it didn't even work.
Maybe next time I visit.

Challenge Questions?
- should data be star/delete be done from list too like on front page?
    - not taking it into account; only be done from ItemFragment for now
