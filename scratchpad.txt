use ListAdapter on front page/fragment
use SimpleAdapter on Item Page/fragment
    - use notifyItem to notify about itemChange

Should I include paging?
    - there are about 4000 items from API
    - task does not say anything, about including pagination though
    - I will just avoid it for now.
        - even if they are so many they will at most consume 10MB which I don't think is a issue, right now
        - so, avoiding premature optimization

let's add the carousel first
    - just found out I could just use viewpage2 since it's can take recyclerview adapter
    - work made so easy
    - now I just have to implement those dots thingy
    - check the tests, how to fake the drag movements?
        - should I be concerned about this? Since I think viewPager2 already handles them. I just have to test if clicking side buttons works
        - skipping this
    - https://github.com/android/views-widgets-samples/tree/main/ViewPager2/app/src/androidTest/java/androidx/viewpager2/integration/testapp/test
    - for now, not going in details/implementations of viewPager2, it has too many working parts
        - assuming it just works, works magically


should I Test Drive the Custom Made Carousel or just integration test it with Fragment rather than with custom tests?
    - it will be fun test driving it thought
    - it will be tough and hard to test but it will be fun
    - to makes test suit faster what I can do is to disable this test in suit, since it should be already tested in fragment
        - IDK, if it's the best thing to do.
    - since this is a specific case here, its better to just test with fragment,since its more of coupled to fragment
        and there is not need to abstract anything, YAGNI

rest API should be fetched only one
    - shouldFetch()
        - if there are no items in Db

Challenge Questions?
- should data be star/delete be done from list too like on front page?
