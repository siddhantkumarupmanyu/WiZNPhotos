should I Test Drive the Custom Made Carousel or just integration test it with Fragment rather than with custom tests?
    - it will be fun test driving it thought
    - it will be tough and hard to test but it will be fun
    - to makes test suit faster what I can do is to disable this test in suit, since it should be already tested in fragment
        - IDK, if it's the best thing to do.

rest API should be fetched only one
    - shouldFetch()
        - if there are no items in Db

Challenge Questions?
- should data be star/delete be done from list too like on front page?
