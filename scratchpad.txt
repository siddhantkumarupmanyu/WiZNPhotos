let's add the carousel first
    - just found out I could just use viewpage2 since it's can take recyclerview adapter
    - work made so easy
    - now I just have to implement those dots thingy
    - check the tests, how to fake the drag movements
    - https://github.com/android/views-widgets-samples/tree/main/ViewPager2/app/src/androidTest/java/androidx/viewpager2/integration/testapp/test


should I Test Drive the Custom Made Carousel or just integration test it with Fragment rather than with custom tests?
    - it will be fun test driving it thought
    - it will be tough and hard to test but it will be fun
    - to makes test suit faster what I can do is to disable this test in suit, since it should be already tested in fragment
        - IDK, if it's the best thing to do.
    - since this is a specific case here, its better to just test with fragment,since its more of coupled to fragment
        and there is not need to abstract anything, YAGNI

rest API should be fetched only one
    - shouldFetch()
        - if there are no items in Db

Challenge Questions?
- should data be star/delete be done from list too like on front page?
